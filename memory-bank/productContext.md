# Healthcare Portal Product Context

## Problem Statement
Healthcare professionals need a unified platform to manage various aspects of their work, including user preferences and ICD tests. Current solutions are often monolithic, making it difficult to:
- Update individual features independently
- Scale specific components as needed
- Maintain consistent user experience across different modules
- Deploy updates without affecting the entire system

## Solution
A micro-frontend architecture that:
1. Separates concerns into independent modules
2. Allows for independent development and deployment
3. Maintains consistent user experience through shared components
4. Enables gradual updates and improvements

## User Experience Goals
1. **Seamless Navigation**
   - Smooth transitions between different modules
   - Consistent UI/UX across all components
   - Clear indication of active module

2. **Performance**
   - Fast initial load time
   - Quick module switching
   - Optimized resource loading

3. **Reliability**
   - Independent module failure handling
   - Graceful degradation
   - Clear error messages

4. **Accessibility**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support

## Technical Requirements
1. **Module Federation**
   - Dynamic loading of micro-frontends
   - Shared dependency management
   - Version compatibility

2. **State Management**
   - Cross-module state sharing
   - Independent module state
   - State persistence

3. **Build System**
   - Independent builds for each module
   - Shared build configuration
   - Optimized bundle sizes

## Integration Points
1. **Host Application**
   - Module loading and routing
   - Shared state management
   - Common UI components

2. **Preferences Module**
   - User settings management
   - Theme customization
   - Language preferences

3. **ICD Tests Module**
   - Test management
   - Results tracking
   - Test scheduling

## Future Considerations
1. **Scalability**
   - Adding new modules
   - Scaling existing modules
   - Performance optimization

2. **Maintenance**
   - Independent updates
   - Version management
   - Dependency updates

3. **Extensibility**
   - New feature integration
   - Third-party module integration
   - Custom module development
