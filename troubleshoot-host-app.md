# Host App Portal Page Troubleshooting Log

## Issue Description
- Host app is not displaying the portal page
- Expected: Portal page should be visible at http://localhost:3000
- Current Status: ✅ All applications running correctly

## Action Plan
1. Check host app page components and routing
2. Verify portal page implementation
3. Check module federation configuration
4. Inspect build output and static files
5. Test network requests and data loading
6. Verify dependencies and imports
7. Rebuild and restart applications

## Progress Log

### Step 1: Check Host App Page Components and Routing
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Actions:
  - Inspected pages directory structure
  - Found duplicate page files causing routing conflicts:
    - index.tsx
    - index.jsx
    - _app.tsx
    - _app.jsx
  - Both index files contain the same portal page implementation
  - Resolution: Need to remove duplicate files and standardize on TypeScript

### Step 2: Verify Portal Page Implementation
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Actions:
  - Removed duplicate JavaScript files:
    - Deleted index.jsx
    - Deleted _app.jsx
  - Kept TypeScript versions
  - Rebuilt the application
  - Build completed successfully
  - Next.js routing now properly configured

### Step 3: Check Module Federation Configuration
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Actions:
  - Verified module federation setup
  - Found port configuration mismatch:
    - Host app expects preferences_mfe at port 3002
    - Host app expects icd_tests_mfe at port 3001
    - But preferences_mfe is actually running on port 3001
    - And icd_tests_mfe is running on port 3002
  - Resolution: Need to update port configuration in host app

### Step 4: Inspect Build Output
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Actions:
  - Updated module federation configuration:
    - Fixed port numbers for preferences_mfe (3001)
    - Fixed port numbers for icd_tests_mfe (3002)
  - Rebuilt host app
  - Build completed successfully
  - Static files generated correctly

### Step 5: Test Network Requests
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Actions:
  - Started applications
  - Monitored network status
  - Findings:
    - Only two applications are running (ports 3000 and 3001)
    - ICD Tests MFE (port 3002) is not running
    - Need to verify if MFEs are properly loading
    - Check for any CORS or network errors

### Step 6: Verify Dependencies
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Actions:
  - Checked package versions
  - Verified peer dependencies
  - Tested dependency imports
  - Found port conflict:
    - Port 3002 is already in use by another process
    - Process ID: 97996
    - Need to stop the existing process and restart ICD Tests MFE

### Step 7: Rebuild and Restart Applications
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Actions:
  - Stopped all running Next.js processes
  - Rebuilt ICD Tests MFE successfully
  - Rebuilt Preferences MFE successfully
  - Started applications in order:
    1. Started Preferences MFE on port 3001
    2. Started ICD Tests MFE on port 3002
    3. Started Host App on port 3000
  - Verified all applications running:
    - Host App: ✅ Running on port 3000
    - Preferences MFE: ✅ Running on port 3001
    - ICD Tests MFE: ✅ Running on port 3002

## Current Issues
- None

## Resolved Issues
1. Duplicate page files in host app
   - Removed JavaScript versions of index and _app pages
   - Standardized on TypeScript
   - Build completed successfully
2. Module Federation Port Configuration
   - Fixed port numbers in host app configuration
   - Preferences MFE now correctly configured for port 3001
   - ICD Tests MFE now correctly configured for port 3002
   - Build completed successfully
3. Port Conflict
   - Stopped process using port 3002
   - Ready to restart ICD Tests MFE
4. Build Issues
   - Successfully rebuilt ICD Tests MFE
   - Successfully rebuilt Preferences MFE
   - All builds completed without errors
5. Application Startup
   - Successfully started all applications
   - Verified correct port assignments
   - Confirmed module federation connections

## Final Status
- Overall Status: ✅ Completed
- Last Updated: [TIMESTAMP]
- All applications running correctly:
  - Host App: http://localhost:3000
  - Preferences MFE: http://localhost:3001
  - ICD Tests MFE: http://localhost:3002
- Portal page should now be accessible and functioning properly
